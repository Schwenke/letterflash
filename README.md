# Letter Flash

### Inspired by the popular online game Wordle.

### Check out the deployed site from github pages here: https://www.letterflash.com/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an open source, replayable version of **Wordle**

Some key points of difference include:

- ### Favor replayability over challenge-of-the-day
  - Letter Flash allows you to keep playing over and over!
- ### Additional features
  - **Extreme mode:** the secret word pulls from the entire dictionary instead of using a curated list. Incredibly difficult, for masochists only!
  - **Support for 6 and 7 letter words**
  - **Stat tracking and history:** Letter flash keeps track of total games played and wins for each word length and several other statistics!
  - **Sharing:** When you finish a puzzle, or from the recent game list, you can copy a link to send to friends. They will load the game with the same word you just solved! And when they go to share the results, the word will be obscured and the original link will be included so others can try!
- ### Fully open source and actively developed
  - The code is available to everyone and so is the issue tracker. I consider this an on-going project and am always looking for new features to add
- ### Purely client side with no server
  - The game loads fast and there is no concern over ads, malicious cookies, or anything of the sort
- ### Easy to build and run
  - This app is built using Angular and typescript and not much else. Grab the code, grab your favorite IDE, npm install, and have at it!


If you enjoy the base Wordle game and would like to play more of it, give Letter Flash a shot!

If you are interested in the project and would like to contribute, let me know.

Special thanks to all of my friends and co-workers who have helped play, test, and play even more of my game to help me refine it!
