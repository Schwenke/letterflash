Inspired by the popular word game, Wordle.

This is a fan-appreciation open source clone I made mostly to work on my front end code skills and because I enjoyed Wordle so much.

The key point of divergence between this game and Wordle is that this game is not one-word-a-day, and instead has infinite replayability.

I also took the time to add some features I thought would be neat, like support for six and seven letter words, as well as a masochist mode.

If you enjoy the base wordle game as much as I do, then you might also enjoy this version.

Please give it a look, critique the source if you like, and share it with your friends if you think they would enjoy it as well.

Thanks for taking a look, and please let me know if you find any issues or have any ideas for feature adds.
