# Letter Flash

### For fans of the popular online game Wordle.

### Check out the deployed site from github pages here: https://www.letterflash.com/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an open source, replayable word game built in Angular.

Key features include:

- ### Infinite replayability
  - Letter Flash dynamically generates a new word on demand, allowing you to keep playing more throughout the day!
- ### Unique options
  - **Extreme mode** 
    - The secret word pulls from the entire dictionary instead of using a curated list. Incredibly difficult, for masochists only!
  - **Support for 6 and 7 letter words**
    - Use the buttons under the options menu to select a word length
    - New games will generate puzzles of that word length!
  - **View previous games, statistics, and more** 
    - Click the "History" button under the options window to view up to your 100 previously played games!
    - Click the "Statistics" button under the options window to view several statistics about your games, such as win streaks!
    - Got a tough word you just can't figure out? Click the "Concede" button under options to give up and see what the word was!
    - Don't like the current word, or just want to start a new game? Click the "Start new game" button under options!
- ### Sharing
  - **Share words with friends and family to see how they fare!** 
    - Letter flash allows you to share specific words via an encoded link which you can send to others
    - The link is included automatically when you share the results of a game you just finished
      - You can also visit the "History" page under options and copy a link there
    - When someone clicks the link, a new game of letter flash will start which uses the word you shared!
- ### Open source and actively developed
  - Feel free to check the code out and leave some feedback!
- ### Easy to build and run
  - This app is built using Angular and typescript and not much else. Grab the code, grab your favorite IDE, npm install, and have at it!
