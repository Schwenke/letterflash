# Letter Flash

### For fans of the popular online game Wordle.

### Check out the deployed site from github pages here: https://www.letterflash.com/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an open source, replayable version of **Wordle**

Some key points of difference include:

- ### Favor replayability over challenge-of-the-day
  - Letter Flash allows you to keep playing over and over!
- ### Additional features
  - **Share puzzles!** 
    - After finishing a game or from the recent game list, you can copy a link to send to friends. 
    - When they open the link, they will start a new game with the word you sent them!
    - When they share results, the word will be obscured and the original link will be included so others can try as well!
  - **Extreme mode** 
    - The secret word pulls from the entire dictionary instead of using a curated list. Incredibly difficult, for masochists only!
  - **Support for 6 and 7 letter words**
    - Use the buttons under the options menu to select a word length. New games will generate puzzles of that word length!
  - **Stat tracking and history** 
    - Buttons in the option menu allow you to view up to 100 recently played games and see rich statistics about your games!
- ### Fully open source and actively developed
  - The code is available to everyone and so is the issue tracker. I consider this an on-going project and am always looking for new features to add
- ### Purely client side with no server
  - The game loads fast and there is no concern over ads, malicious cookies, or anything of the sort
- ### Easy to build and run
  - This app is built using Angular and typescript and not much else. Grab the code, grab your favorite IDE, npm install, and have at it!


If you enjoy the base Wordle game and would like to play more of it, give Letter Flash a shot!

If you are interested in the project and would like to contribute, let me know.

Special thanks to all of my friends and co-workers who have helped play, test, and play even more of my game to help me refine it!
